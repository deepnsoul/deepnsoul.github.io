- In 1930, the astrologer R.H. Naylor predicted several important events for Princess Margraret in a London newspaper.
- After those uncanny prediction, the newspaper gave Naylor a regular column and he started **casting horoscopes** for ordinary readers.
- This idea **caught on with** other papers too.

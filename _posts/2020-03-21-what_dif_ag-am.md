- In a world where we thought everything in the universe orbited us, astronomy was **mapping out** the stars and planets, and astrology was interpreting their influence over us.
- But, then, scientists like Galileo Galilei found that we actually orbit the sun and started developing a system for determining what was true by the scientific method in the 17th century.
- Since astrology failed to pass the scientific test, it **fell out of fashion** for hundreds of years.

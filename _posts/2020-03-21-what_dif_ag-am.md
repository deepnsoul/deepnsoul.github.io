- In the past, humans had assumed there was no difference between astrology and astronomy.
- This was because people thought that we were the center of the universe in that time.
- However, as Galileo Galilei **came up with** that we actually orbit the Sun and scientific methods **took off**, they were forever split.
- Since astrology could not be proven by scientific method, it **fell out of fashion** for a long time.

tags: astrology

- In a world where we thought everything in the universe orbited us, astronomy was **mapping out** the stars and planets, and astrology was interpreting their influence over us.
- Then, scientists like Galileo Galilei found that we actually orbit the sun.
- Moreover, in the 17th century, we started developing a system for determining what was true by the scientific method.
- Since astrology failed to pass the scientific test, it **fell out of fashion** for hundreds of years.

- The required skills of a data journalist range between coding, designing, and journalism. A data journalist should be good at least one of these.
- It's not about how many developers you have, but what you do with them.
- The key thing they have in common is that they're based on numbers and statistics and they should aim to get a story out of that data.
- It is about the process of how to turn numbers into a story, whether the story is comprised of words or graphics is irrelevant.
- Anyone can do it:
  - You don't need to immediately compete with the NYT or The Guardian.
  - Quick, messily created things can be hits: it's the information and the correct facts that are vital.
  - Visualization is not always needed.
  - Start small: Argentina's La Nacion, the best data journalism site in South America, started without a programmer and by using free software.

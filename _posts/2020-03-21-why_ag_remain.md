- In 1930, the astrologer R.H. Naylor predicted several important events for Princess Margraret in a London newspaper.
- After those uncanny prediction, the newspaper gave Naylor a regular column and he started **casting horoscopes** for ordinary readers.
- This idea **caught on with** other papers too.
- Psychoanalysis also **gave astrology a big boost** around this time.
- One of the founders of psychoanalysis was Carl Jung he popularized the idea of personality types.
- Jung said that "my evenings **are taken up very largely with** astrology." **in his correspondence with** Sigmund Freud.
-Astrology is definitely more art than science. That doesn't mean it doesn't have a lot of value to people's lives. People all wonder what our day has **in store** for us and what our future holds.
- The positive outlook you can get from reading a horoscope can even make you preform better on cognitive and creativity tests. **That belief in something can be enough**.
